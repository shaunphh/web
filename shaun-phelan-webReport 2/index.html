              <p class="body1">Today, the internet has revolutionized how we live our modern lives. From banking, to communication, shopping, education and entertainment. The internet fundamentally changed how we communicate, how we shop, how we consume media, how we meet people, how we learn, how we bank. IN a relatively short period of time, the internet has touched on almost every aspect of modern society, becoming an essential utility in 21st century life.
                The development of the right combination of hardware, software and technology took decades and
                The early origins of the internet can be traced back to 1957. Prior to this, computers were colossal inefficient machines that filled an entire room only capable of calculating complex mathematical problem, one task at a time. As their power increased so too did their size. Eventually they became so large, they needed to be stored in cooled rooms where developers could not work on the machines directly. Instead they relied on computer specialists to connect the computer. This ineffective process lead to an increase in cost, time and bugs.
              </p>
              <p class="body1">1957 marked the first year where a remote connection was established. This allowed developers to work and interact directly with the computers, without the need for specialist. It was also at this time, 1957, that the concept on time-sharing originate. This allowed multiple users to share the processing power of one ‘super computer’ allowing multiple computers to work on different calculations simultaneously. This marked the beginning of cloud computing as we      know   it today. On October 4th, 1954, the cold war was well underway. During this time, the Soviet Union launched their first unmanned satellite ‘Sputnik 1’ into orbit. Forcing the Americans into
              a Space race with the Soviet Union and accelerating technological and scientific development.

            <p class="body3">By 1962 American Ferret aircrafts discovered long rand missiles in Cuba, capable of reaching the United States. These 2 global events, stoked fear of an intercontinental nuclear conflict and inadvertently sparked the creation of the internet.
                In a direct response these events, the US Department of Defense launched the Direct Advanced Research Agency, in February 1958 in an attempt to maintain it’s technology lead over the Soviets. DARPA set out to establish a knowledge transfer system with a large scale computer network, The first of its kind. This network eventually became know as the Arpanet. Which later would evolve into the world wide web as we know it today.
                The Arperntet network began development in 1966. Arpernet began as a simple messaging like service between UCLA, UC Santa Barbra, Stanford and the University of Utah.

              <h3 class="internet-heading">History</h3>
              <p class="internet">At this time, universes were reluctant to connect their computers, instead smaller computers known as Interface Message Processors were put in front of the main frame.
                These computers handled all network activities, while the mainframe handle data files and the initialization of programs. The IMP also served as an interface for the mainframe. Only the imps were interconnected in the network and bypassed the mainframe. The Network protocol was the early network used to connect these computers, later this was replaced with the more efficient, Transmission Protocol.which verified file transfer protocol.
                This agency is also widely responsible for the development of the foundation of the modern day internet. The RAND Corporation of America also created a military network in America.
                Also at this time Englands National Physical lavatory created their commercial network. And the scientific network, Cyclades in France.
                Collectively this series of networks formed the foundations of the internet as we currently know it. <br> Fear of a missile attack necessitated the development of a decentralized network architecture. Meaning that if a node was lost due to an attack, the network would still be operational. Similarly, the event of an atomic attack would mean communication via ionosphere radio waves would no longer be effective. Shorted range direct wave communication methods were developed alongside a distributed network. Meaning longer distances could be covered than the direct wave channels with minimal threat of interference.

                <p class="body2">In 1999 a British computer scientist, Tim Berners-Lee outlined his vision for an interconnected world wide network of computers. This vision is what we know today as the world wide web. Along side this, he developed a language that this web of networks was based on. Hyper Text Markup Language, or HTML as it is more commonly known today was among the first programming languages that was readable and understandable by both computer and human alike. Today it      continues to be used as the standard
                As the web continued to expand throughout the 1990’s, and new web browsers and stands were established,
                World Wide Web Consortium was established in 1994 and set out to develop, standardize the and formalize the world wide web.

      <p>TThe Gnu and Linux open source movement came about shortly after the Web. While at the NCSA Marc Andreesen established the Mosaic browser. The internet experienced a huge surge in popularity soon after its release. The ability to show inline images and support of additional character set were some of the many reasons it enjoyed such success. JIS (Japanese), Big-8 (Chinese) and other ISO variants allowed the Web to grow past Europe and the United States.
Mosaic gave birth to a number of versions. In 1994 Andreesen left NCSA and went on to build Netscape. A browser that featured multithreading, meaning tasks can be performed in the background, was something very important to dial-up internet users of the day.  It introduced encryption, and Javascript. It heralded in the age of e-commerce.

      <p class="cat2">
During this period Microsoft built their own browser called Internet Explorer. IE had a great advantage in that it was soon packaged with Windows 95 the worlds largest OS. This made it hard for Netscape to survive ultimately conceding and consolidating into the Mozilla corporation. 2003 saw the launch of Safari by Apple. Soon after in 2004 Mozilla rejoined the race with Firefox 1.0. These release saw Internet explorer popularity drop for the first time in a decade. Tho its dominance lasted well into the 21st century. It wasnt until the search engine Google launched its own browser; Chrome in 2008 Internet explorer found serious competition. Google Chrome was light-weight, fast and stable. These features eventually made it the browser of choice for most people. </p>

                <h4 class="html-heading">HTML</h4>
                <p class="html-text">HTML is a markup language. A markup language is a set of instructions on how to create a document, like a Web page. It is not a programming language that describes what something does. Nor does it specify what those things look like. HTML could however be described as the raw materials with which the internet is built.
<br>HTML 5, first published in 2008, is a markup language used for structuring content on the web. It aimed to streamline and standardize the the language and make it compatible with the latest multimedia and web features.
The latest HTML release adds serval new syntactic features, elements and attributes, all of which make HTML files more legible by both humans and machines. This is the first substantial update to what the web can do since 1999.

            <h3 class="intro">The Future</h3>
              <p class="body1"> Looking at the future pessimistically, issues such as the lack of Net Neutrality could see only a few large companies remain on the internet. Consumers could be left with few options online. Like most monopolies, large corporations become greedy, and innovation grinds to a halt. Costs to use the internet could become exorbitant. Torrenting and file sharing might vanish due to increasingly sophisticated technological filtering and through fear of prosecution. All internet activity is monitored by corporations and governments. You can have no expectation of privacy on the internet, everything page you view or word you search could be used against you.<br>On a brighter note the internet could also really benefit smaller scale industries, 3-D printing, open-source hardware, etc, could see peer-to-peer production and selling of goods becoming a significant part of the global economy. A free and open more distributed Internet. One that is closer to what was imagined by its creators is certainly the more favourable outcome.
